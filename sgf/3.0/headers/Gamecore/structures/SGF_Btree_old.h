Binary Trees

 Binary trees are different from the three previous structures we have covered before. Lists, stacks, and queues were all linear structures, that is, the elements in them were logically following each other.

 A binary tree structure contains a root node, which is the first in the structure. The root points to one or two other nodes, its left and right children. The root is considered to be a parent of these two nodes. Each child is also a sub-tree, since it can have one or two children of its own. If a node has no children, it is referred to as a leaf node.

 Each node in the tree also has a level associated with it. The root node is at level 0, and increases with each row of nodes below the root.

 Binary trees have many different basic implementations. An array implementation is often times used, where every level must be completely filled. In larger trees, this can be a very big waste of space. For our demonstration, we will create a generic class using dynamic memory allocation. This particular implementation was created by the author using a mixture of possible approaches. It is very effective in explaining the concepts behind binary trees.

 The binary tree class gives the programmer complete control over the tree. Nodes may be removed and inserted into any location in the list. The class allows the user to traverse the tree by keeping a current pointer, just as in the linked list class. The programmer can then use the functions left(), right(), and parent() to move from one node to another. The class also allows the user to display the tree in in-order, post-order, and pre-order. The "order" refers to how the nodes are displayed. For instance, in pre-order, a node's value is displayed, then the value of its left child, followed by the right child. In the case of in-order, the node's value is displayed between the value of its left and right child. In post order, the node's children are displayed before it. The implementation for the binary tree class is displayed below. Although it may look intimidating at first, the code is very easy to follow. The purpose and code behind each function is explained following the definition. You will note, most functions are programmed using recursion. Since each node is actually a tree within itself, using recursion is the easiest approach

 Many books make a class for a single node, and use it to implement the tree. However, we will separate the structure for each node and the entire tree to conserve overhead processing time. Each time a node is created, much less time and memory is used than when a whole tree structure is made. Each node will store a value, and pointers to its children and parent. These will be used and modified by the general tree class.

Binary expression trees store mathematical expression, for instance, 5*x+7=22. Each character of the expression is represented by one node. They are stored in such a way that the expression can then be displayed using an in-order traversal. Also, pre-order and post-order traversals will display the mathematical expression using prefix and postfix notations. This means an operator stored in a node perform an operation on its two children. In such a setup, all operators are internal nodes, whereas variables and constants are leafs. The code for the NodeCount() and LeafCount() functions is displayed below. Both are very short since recursion is used.

 /*
Binary Search Trees

 Another type of special binary tree is the binary search tree (BinarySearchTree). 
 BSTs must conform to a property that states all the left children of a node have a lesser value than the node, 
 and all the right children have a value greater than the node. 
 In order to make our binary tree class a BinarySearchTree, we need only modify the insert() function, 
 since nodes can no longer be placed anywhere in the tree by the programmer. 
 Otherwise, a BinarySearchTree acts in the same fashion as a standard binary tree.

 The new insert() function accepts one parameter, the item to be inserted. 
 If the tree is empty, then the main root is added in the same fashion as it was with a standard binary tree, and the function exits. If the tree is not empty, the function proceeds with a new algorithm.

 The parent of the new node is found by running the insert_find() function, a new private member function that must be added to the BinarySearchTree class. 
 The insert_find() function accepts two parameters - the root of the tree and the item value. 
 The root is needed as a parameter because insert_find() uses recursion to traverse the tree. 
 The function works by comparing the value of item to each node. 
 If it is less than the node's value, and the node has a left child, the function proceeds to that child and performs the same operation. 
 If it is greater (or equal to) than the node's value, and a right child exists, then the function proceeds to the right child.
 If item is less than the node and a left child does not exist, or it is more than the node and a right child does not exist, 
 that is where the new node belongs.

 The insert() function receives a pointer to the new parent, however, we must check again if the new node is to be the left or right child. 
 This is because there is no efficient way a recursive version of insert_find() can return this information. 
 We would have to add another parameter, or write a non-recursive version of insert_find(). 
 Both methods are far more space and time consuming than simply performing another check.

 A new node is then created using the same method as in the original version of insert().

	/*
 Since the programmer is no longer in control of the location of each node, we can add a function that removes one node at a time. 
 The reason we did not implement such a function for the standard binary tree class is that we do not know how the program requires the structure to handle removing a node. 
 If the node to be deleted is a leaf, the solution is simple. We set its parent's pointer to NULL. 
 If it has one child, then the parent is set to point to that child. However, what happens if the node has two children ? 
 How should we insert those children back into the tree once the node is deleted ? 
 The solution can vary, depending on the programming task. 
 Since a binary search tree follows a specific property, we can libraryelop an algorithm that maintains the binary search tree property when rearranging the node's children.
 The code for the remove_node() function may look difficult at first, however when broken down into each possible situation, it is very simple to understand. 
 The first case that must be considered is if we wish to remove the main root, and it has only one child. 
 In this situation, that child becomes the new main root.
 If the node to be deleted has no children, node's parent is set to point to NULL, and node is then deleted.
 Also as mentioned before, if node has one child, the parent of node is set to point to this child, and node is then deleted.
 If delete_node has two children, a little bit more work must be done. 
 The question arises as to how to attach delete_node's children to the tree, while preserving the binary search tree property. 
 One possible solution would be to attach one of the children to delete_node's parent, and reinsert each node from the second child subtree one-by-one. 
 However, this method is very inefficient, especially if the node to be deleted has a very large subtree.
 The ideal approach is to find another node in the tree, which can replace delete_node, and still maintain the binary search tree property. 
 We can then replace the value of delete_node, and remove the node who's value we replaced it with instead. 
 The possible nodes that would fit such a criteria are the largest node in the left subtree, and the smallest node in the right subtree. 
 The largest node in the left subtree is still smaller than any node of the right subtree, and the smallest node in the right subtree is larger than any node in the left subtree, 
 therefore making both possible values that can replace root. 
 If a right subtree exists, then it is used, since it may contain a value that is equal to delete_node (in which case that value will be used).
 The largest node in the left subtree can be found by moving to the left one time (starting from delete_node), and then moving to the right as much as possible. The smallest node in the right subtree can be found by moving once to the right, and then to the left as much as possible. This means that either node will have at most one child (the largest node in the left subtree can only have a left child, and the smallest node in the right subtree can only have a right child). It can therefore be removed using the above method, by attaching that child to the node's parent.

 The replace_find() private member function returns the node that is used to replace delete_node. The first parameter of the function is a pointer to the first possible node (if we are searching the left subtree, this value is root->left, whereas it is root->right if we are searching the right subtree), and the second parameter is what direction to search in. Zero means the function will locate the largest value in the left subtree, meaning it will travel to the right as much as possible. A value of one means the function will locate the smallest value in the right subtree, therefore travelling to the left as much as possible. Once the node is found, delete_node is set to its value, and the node is deleted.
